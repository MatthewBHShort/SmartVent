# SmartVent

Product: SmartVent - Venty

Description: Air Vent with wireless control to open / close the vent. Temperature sensor in the unit as well.

Purpose: Better thermal management in homes. Reduce cold pockets and warm pockets in homes. 
	- 	Comfort 
	-	 Environmental Impact 
	-	 Affordability

Functional Requirements: 
In hot months, reduce AC flow to cold rooms/areas of a home (basement for example) or in our case the kitchen bathroom.

In cold months, direct warm air to colder areas of home, basements or poorly insulated rooms.

Objectives / Features:
	- Wireless connectivity 
	- Smart Control (automatically operates to balance the home temperature, working in a network of vents)
	- Low cost, high compatibility
	- Magnets on the walls of the register to attach to air duct. Allows for ceiling installation / tool free


Constraints: 
Getting power to the vent will prove tricky. Whether its direct AC, batteries or a solar cell
Weight - needs to work in ceiling vents
Cost - Some solutions already exist at a high price


Things to consider:

Over pressurizing ductwork. If many vents are closed the pressure will increase in the ductwork and this can lead to overworking the furnace / ac. This means we don’t want to fully seal all vents. This limitation sort of works in our favour. We don’t have to aim to replace all vents in every room. 1-2 vents depending on the size of the room and dynamics of the home.

Different air vent sizes / configurations.

Most common air vents:

	- 4” x 10”




Air register is for bringing air INTO room. Air grill is for pulling air OUT of room
